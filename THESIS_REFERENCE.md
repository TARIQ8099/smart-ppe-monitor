## System Name
**Sentry-Judge PPE Compliance Monitoring System**

## Core Concept: The Absence Detection Paradox
Object detectors excel at finding *present* objects (helmets, vests) but struggle to detect *absent* equipment. Detecting `no_helmet` requires reasoning about what *should* be present — a fundamentally harder task than detecting what *is* present.

## Architecture: Decoupled Sentry-Judge Pipeline

```
Video → SENTRY (YOLO+ByteTrack) → Queue → JUDGE (SAM 3) → DB → REPORTER (LLM+PDF)
         30 FPS, non-blocking       async    ~400ms/ROI         end-of-day
```

### The Sentry (Fast Detector)
- **Model:** YOLO26m (5 classes: Helmet, Vest, Person, no-helmet, no-vest)
- **Tracker:** ByteTrack — assigns persistent Person IDs across frames
- **Role:** Real-time triage at 25-30 FPS. Never waits for SAM.
- **Cooldown:** Per-person, per-violation-type. Default 5 min. Prevents alert spam.
- **Output:** Cropped ROI images + JSON payloads pushed to queue
- **File:** `backend/services/sentry.py`

### The Judge (Semantic Verifier)
- **Model:** SAM 3 (Segment Anything with Concepts) via SAM3SemanticPredictor
- **Role:** Background consumer. Verifies YOLO's uncertain cases.
- **2-Step Verification:**
  - Step 0 — **Person Check:** "Is this a person?" (positive) + "Is this a machine/building?" (negative). If object_conf > person_conf → REJECT.
  - Step 1 — **PPE Check:** "Is there a helmet/vest in this ROI?" If found → REJECT violation (YOLO was wrong).
- **File:** `backend/services/judge.py`

### 5-Path Decision Logic (in Sentry)

| Path | Condition | Action | Judge Needed |
|------|-----------|--------|:---:|
| 0: Fast Safe | Helmet + Vest detected | SAFE — skip queue | No |
| 1: Fast Violation | `no_helmet` class detected | Queue HEAD ROI | Yes |
| 2: Rescue Head | Vest found, no helmet info | Queue HEAD ROI | Yes |
| 3: Rescue Body | Helmet found, no vest info | Queue TORSO ROI | Yes |
| 4: Critical | No PPE info at all | Queue FULL person crop | Yes |

### Geometric Prompt Engineering
- **Head ROI:** Top 40% of person bounding box (helmet verification)
- **Torso ROI:** 20-100% of person bounding box (vest verification)
- Reduces SAM compute by ~60-70% vs processing full images

## Test Results (Colab, NVIDIA T4)

### Judge Person Verification Test
- **Input:** 3 ROIs (all buildings/machinery misdetected as persons by YOLO)
- **Result:** 3/3 correctly rejected as "NOT a person"
- **Method:** 2-way SAM check (person prompts vs object/machine prompts)

### Pipeline Metrics (from earlier coupled system test)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| SAM bypass rate | 74.1% (Path 0) |
| Effective FPS (hybrid) | 16.3 |
| YOLO-only FPS | ~30 |
| SAM avg latency | 376 ms/verification |
| Tracking | Successfully tracked across 315 frames |

> **Note:** Run the full decoupled pipeline with real workers video to get updated metrics.
